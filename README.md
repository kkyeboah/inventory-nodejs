# Setup
#### Using docker:
- [Download and install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- Copy docker-compose.override.example.yml to docker-compose.override.yml to extend services and compose files. Refer [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends)

```sh
$ cd <project_folder>
$ docker-compose up [-d]
```
`-d` runs docker as a daemon
